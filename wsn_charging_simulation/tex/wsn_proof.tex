\section{Background}
UAV can be used to charge nodes to prolong the life of the wireless sensor network. To charge a node, UAV has to fly to the specific node. UAV itself can be charged at UAV base station. Given the information of the UAV, UAV base station and wireless sensor nodes, what is the optimal strategy for UAV to keep the network alive in the given time limit with minimal cost of resources? we call this problem as UAVWW problem.

\section{Description}
\noindent
\textbf{INSTANCE:} 
A graph $G_s = (V, E)$, a vertex $base \in V$, a series of numbers $e_{max} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, $e_{init} \in [0, e_{max}]$, $e_{cf} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$, $e_{ct} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$, $r \in [0, 1]$, $e_r \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, $v \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, $E_{max} \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$, $E_{init} \in [0, E_{max}]$, $E_{c} \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$, $T \in \mathbb{R}_{\geq0}$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}_{\geq0}$.

\textbf{QUESTION:}

One UAV, has energy capacity of $e_{max}$ and initial energy of $e_{init}$. UAV consumes energy of $e_{cf}$ per second for flight, and energy of $e_{ct}$ per second for transferring energy from UAV to the nodes in the network. The transfer efficiency rate is $r$ (i.e. node can receive energy of $e_{ct}*r$ per second). When UAV is at UAV base station, UAV can receive energy of $e_r$ per second. The moving speed of UAV is $v$. The initial position of UAV is $base$. UAV has four types of instructions: (1)hover at current position for time $t$, $t \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$; (2)fly from $A$ to $B$, $A,B \in V$, and this instruction is invalid if UAV is not at $A$. (3)charge $A$ for $t$ second, $A \in V$ and $A$ is not $base$, $t \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$, and this instruction is invalid if UAV is not at $A$; (4)charge UAV for $t$ second, $t \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}$, and this instruction is invalid if UAV is not at $base$.

A set of wireless sensor nodes $V' = V - {base}$. Each node has energy capacity of $E_{max}$ and initial energy of $E_{init}$. Each node consumes energy of $E_{c}$ per second.

We say the system is dead when any of the conditions is satisfied:
(1)the energy of the UAV falls to 0 and UAV is not at $base$;
(2)the energy of any of the wireless sensor nodes falls to 0.

we count it as a UAV task when UAV flies out from $base$.

The question is: is there a finite sequence of valid UAV instructions can keep the system alive for time period of $T$ with at most $k$ UAV tasks?

\section{Proof}
It is easy to see that UAVWW $\in NP$, because a nondeterministic algorithm need only guess a sequence of UAV instructions and simulate the instructions until the end of the instructions or the total time passes $T$ in polynomial time, and check that if the system is alive during the simulation and the number of UAV tasks is less than or equal to $k$.

We transform TRAVELING SALESMAN to UAVWW. Let an arbitrary instance of TRAVELING SALESMAN be the graph $G = (V, E)$ and $L \in \mathbb{N}_{>0}$.

We can construct a graph $G_s = G$, and then randomly choose a vertex from $V$ as $base$. We set the parameters as: $e_{max} = |V| + |L| - 1$, $e_{init} = |V| + |L| - 1$, $e_{cf} = 1$, $e_{ct} = 1$, $r = 1.0$, $e_r = 0$, $v = 1$., $E_{max} = |V| + |L| - 1$, $E_{init} = |V| + |L| - 2$, $E_{min} = 0$, $E_{c} = 1$, $T = |V| + |L| - 1$ and $k = 1$.

Also, it is clear that this transformation can be finished in polynomial time.
