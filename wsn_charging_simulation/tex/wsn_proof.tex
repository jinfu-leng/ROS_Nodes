\section{Background}
It is expensive to replace battery of nodes in wireless sensor network.
It is flexible and affordable to use UAV to charge nodes in wirelss sensor network.
\section{Description}
We consider a set of sensor nodes $N$ distributed over a graph $G$. Each sensor node has a battery capacity of $E_{max}$, an initial energy of $E_{init}$, and the minimal energy of $E_{min}$. We say that the network is dead when the energy of any of the nodes falls below $E_{min}$. Each node consumes energy of $E_{c}$ per second.

There is an UAV in the system to charge these nodes. The UAV has a battery capacity of $e_{max}$. UAV consumes energy of $e_{cf}$ per second for flight, and consumes energy of $e_{ct}$ per second for transferring power to the nodes. The transfer rate from UAV to nodes is $r$.

There is an UAV base station in the system to charge the UAV. UAV can receive energy of $e_r$ per second. UAV has to come back to station before its power falls below $0$.

For UAV, there are two types of valid commands:
1, fly from node A to node B
2, charge node A for $t$ second

The problem is, suppose we want to keep the network to work as long as time of $T$, what is the minimal number of charging tasks the UAV has to execute. Every time UAV going out of the base station counts as one charging task.

The decision version of the problem is, given time of $T$, is the UAV able to keep the system working as long as $T$ with less than $k$ tasks.
\section{Proof}
Given an instance $I$ or $Travelling Salesman Problem$, we can transform it into an instance $I'$ of $UAV Charging Problem$.
